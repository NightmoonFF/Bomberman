I'm thinking we should split a message into two things - Command, Parameter
What indicates a command message, would be a full caps word at start.
If needed, could add name/signature - but currently trying to just keep clients mapped
So for example, an input request sequence from client would go like maybe


JOIN Elias
MOVE UP
MOVE UP
MOVE DOWN
BOMB
BOMB (maybe unable here due to cooldown for example)
MOVE UP
QUIT (out of rage)



[Commands {Params}]

MOVE {direction}

BOMB {}

JOIN {username}

QUIT{}

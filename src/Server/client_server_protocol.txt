Instruction messages used to communicate between client/server are split into two elements: Command and Parameter
What indicates an instruction/command message, is a full caps word at start.
So for example, an input request sequence from client would go like this:

JOIN Elias
MOVE up Elias
MOVE up Elias
MOVE down Elias
BOMB Elias
BOMB Elias - (maybe unable here due to cooldown for example)
MOVE up Elias
QUIT Elias - (from rage)



[Commands {Params}]

MOVE {direction}{name}

BOMB {name}

JOIN {name, x, y}

QUIT {name}

READY {name}

I'm thinking we should split a message into three things - Command, Name, and Parameter
What indicates a command message, would be a full caps word at start.
If needed, could add name/signature - but currently trying to just keep clients mapped
So for example, an input request sequence from client would go like maybe


JOIN Elias
MOVE Elias up
MOVE Elias up
MOVE Elias down
BOMB Elias
BOMB Elias (maybe unable here due to cooldown for example)
MOVE Elias up
QUIT Elias (from rage)



[Commands {Params}]

MOVE {name} {direction}

BOMB {name}

JOIN {name, x, y}

QUIT{name}
